# Spotipyn
A Spotify-based web application that allows users to place annotations, or 'pins', into songs at specified timestamps. These pins can be customized with a message and a duration.

## Prerequisites
1. [Install MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) (v10.6.4) to create a local database source in your IDE. If you're using PyCharm, see the instructions [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/mariadb.html).

## Getting started
**Step 1:** Clone the repository from terminal `git clone https://github.com/lunarmint/spotipyn.git`. If you use GitHub Desktop, cloning the repository with it will achieve a similar result.

**Step 2:** Create a copy of `.env.example` file, rename it to `.env` and fill in all the required variables as specified in the file.

**Step 3:** Create a copy of `config.default.yml` file, rename it to `config.yml` and fill in all the required variables as specified in the file.

**Step 4:** From the terminal, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

**Step 5:** The entry point to interpret the application will be `spotipyn.py`.
